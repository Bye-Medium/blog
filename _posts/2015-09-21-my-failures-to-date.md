# My failures (to date)

## 

*This is a post first published in January 2012 from my long lost WordPress blog and reposted here for posterity.*

I’ve run 8 different businesses over the last 10 years. Some have been successful, most have failed.

You can read a lot of blog posts out about successful startups, projects or campaigns but few people post about the ones that sucked. Here is a list of some of my failed projects.

## 360Desktop (2008)

**What was it?**
An angel-funded startup building a Windows application that extended your desktop into a panoramic display giving you (in theory) more screen real estate. I joined as the marketing manager.

**Why did it fail?**
A range of issues but I think the biggest red flag was when I was hired with the view that they would launch the product the following week. 6 months later and with the launch nowhere in sight I left the company to do something actually productive. I think it took them another year or so to launch and not long afterwards the company folded leaving a bunch of employees out of pocket.

**What did I learn?**
Know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. I also met some incredible people, particularly user experience designers Benson Low and Adam Schilling.

## Mr Chop (2009)

**What was it?**
A music-centric blogger advertising network I started in part to monetize my own blog. [http://electrorash.com](http://electrorash.com/)

**Why did it fail?**
The network made a bit of money but nothing significant. It certainly didn’t get much beyond ramen profitable, and not consistently.

That said, over the last 12 months I’ve revived the business as a service we offer through Native. With a stronger client base and a better understanding of media buying it has definitely been a good addition to our bottom line.

**What did I learn?**
A great idea is nothing without the right networks or distribution. Also ad sales isn’t hard when you’ve got a good product. Also sometimes a good idea needs a couple of years to work — for me I needed to learn how to sell media and manage client accounts well before this business made sense.

## Orgnition (late 2009)

**What was it?**
An organisation management system for not for profit organisations, specifically those like Rotary or Lions clubs.

**Why did it fail?**
We underestimated the strengths and overestimated the weaknesses of our competitor. We also massively underestimated the sales cycle. It’s not an easy task to sell a technical product to older organisations, especially when their existing solution doesn’t completely suck.

**What did I learn?**
It’s better to do something you know than chase a dollar. Also working with non-profit organisations is not an easy task. I still believe in the solution that we had but think that it will be some time before I step back into this space.

There are plenty of other ideas I worked on but didn’t go anywhere with. I have notebooks filled with ideas, research and sketches. But the above are ones I spent any considerable amount of time on.

During this period I also made the conscious decision to treat each failure as a learning experience, to resign myself to failure as if each project were another semester of study into how to build a company.

I didn’t start any of these projects wanting to fail but I always went in with the idea that it was about the process, “the journey” rather than the end result.
