# Drew Houston on choosing DropBox as his next idea

*This is a post first published in July 2011 from my long lost WordPress blog and reposted here for posterity.*

I found this great post from Drew Houston, founder of DropBox, on Hacker News.

Someone had asked him if Dropbox (currently valued at $5b) [Update: valued at $10bn in January 2015] was his first idea.
> [I] informally came up with and tossed around 6 or 7 ideas at the same time — not so much coding as investigating/talking to potential customers and bouncing them off other friends and entrepreneurs.
> this was crucial — ideas don’t really fall out of the sky, they evolve.
> there were several times where i’d get really excited about one idea — like pacing in my living room at 5:30am excited — and then 5 days later find out (via a different set of search terms or something) there were 3 other people doing the same thing, with a head start and more money.
> ultimately they say scratch your own itch — this was a problem (syncing a 3gb file across several computers efficiently) i routinely had working on a prior company i had started and i was frustrated that no one had solved it well, and it turned out to be more promising than my original company :)
