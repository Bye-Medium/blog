## FKA Twigs

You will never be as blank a canvas as you are in your first 30 days on a new project.

And the best way to spend them is in consumption mode, not production.

Listening, asking questions, learning, absorbing all the information you can get your hands on.

No attempts at providing value or building anything. As close to zero real-world productivity as possible.

30 days might sound like a lot of time but in reality if you’re embarking on a multi-year effort this is a critical time for you to use your untrained eyes and ears to approach the problems in unexpected ways.

Take the time to familiarize yourself with the product, the customers, the people, the industry and it’s history. Ask as many questions as you can. Take notes.

If you insist on an output make it tangential to your primary gig. A document of your learnings, an organizational chart, a cultural reflection.

After my first 30 days at GoDaddy I put together a presentation on what I learned from the GoDaddy culture which I shared with the team.

It wasn’t some hefty tome, it was a reflection back on the organization of my experiences of their culture based on my 30 day experience.

Don’t waste your first 30 days.
