# The Product Management reading playlist

## 

A [reading playlist](https://medium.com/things-ive-written/updating-my-text-playlist-3c75f5999bd0) is a lot like a music playlist — a collection of articles you can listen to again and again which, when combined, tell a story.

It’s an easy way to share ideas around a topic.

I’m at a [conference](https://salesandmarketingjam.com) this week in New Zealand on sales, marketing and product for founders and figured I’d put together my reading playlist to share what I read about when I’m reading about product.

**On getting to product market fit:**

Sachin Rekhi on [documenting your product/market fit hypothesis](http://www.sachinrekhi.com/a-lean-alternative-to-a-business-plan-documenting-your-product-market-fit-hypotheses) as a form of lean business plan; then how to [design your customer validation to maximize product/market fit](http://www.sachinrekhi.com/how-to-design-your-customer-validation-to-maximize-product-market-fit). by Sachin Rekhi

Dan McFunley on building [data driven products](https://speakerdeck.com/mcfunley/data-driven-products-now) at Etsy.

To help you get to that hypothesis it helps to get back to first principles with the classic [5 whys](http://designresearchtechniques.com/casestudies/5-whys/).

Sean Ellis’ classic product market fit survey — [“How disappointed would you be if this product no longer existed?”](http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/).

The [devils roadmap](https://blog.intercom.io/666-product-roadmap/) for founders and PMs.

[Product strategy means saying no](https://blog.intercom.io/product-strategy-means-saying-no/), by Des Trayner of Intercom.io (via [Rich Chetwynd](http://twitter.com/richchetwynd))

**On being a better Product Manager:**

Ben Horowitz [“Good PM, Bad PM”](https://a16z.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/good-product-manager.pdf).

This incredible [job description](http://careers.upserve.com/apply/WSQlYS/Product-Manager) for product managers is a great wrap up of what the perfect “resume” looks like.

**Books to read:**
